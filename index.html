  <h3 id="consulting-description-title">What I Do (Client-Focused)</h3>
  <p><strong>Unlock Efficiency and Reduce Costs:</strong> I analyse current workflows and systems to pinpoint where time, money, and effort are being lost, then provide clear, prioritised recommendations that deliver measurable savings aligned to your strategy.</p>
  <p><strong>Streamline Processes for Sustainable Growth:</strong> Using practical Lean and continuous improvement methods, I partner with your teams to redesign processes, eliminate waste, simplify approvals and reporting, and free up staff capacity.</p>
  <p><strong>Lead Change with Confidence:</strong> I design and deliver change programs that win buy-in. Through stakeholder workshops and executive-ready reporting, staff understand the “why,” embrace the “how,” and sustain the “what.”</p>
  <p><strong>Build Capability and Future-Proof:</strong> Beyond quick wins, I embed skills, tools, and governance so improvements stick—aligning process changes with compliance, strategy, and customer expectations to make your organisation more agile and resilient.</p>
